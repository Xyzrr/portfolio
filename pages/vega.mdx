At Weights & Biases, I was responsible for the design and development of the custom chart editor (or more dramatically, the [Machine Learning Visualization IDE](https://wandb.ai/wandb/posts/reports/The-W-B-Machine-Learning-Visualization-IDE--VmlldzoyNjk3Nzg)).

Previously, W&B users had to use prebuilt charts (line plots, scatter plots, tables, etc.) with limited configuration options to visualize their data. The custom chart editor utilized the [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) visualization grammar to enable users to visualize their data however they wanted. As of July 2021, custom charts are used in thousands of W&B projects.

Here's some examples of charts made using the custom chart editor:

These are interactive in the actual product. You can check them out [here](https://wandb.ai/wandb/posts/reports/The-W-B-Machine-Learning-Visualization-IDE--VmlldzoyNjk3Nzg).

## Considerations

The custom chart editor is designed for power users, making functionality more important than aesthetic. The editor's UI is considerably more dense than most of the rest of the W&B product.

## Process

To develop user empathy, I became my own user. While iterating on the custom chart editor, I used it to build my own custom chart. To keep it entertaining for myself, I made an odd chart: a [2D platformer](http://localhost:3000/platformer).
