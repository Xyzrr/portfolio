[Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) is a visualization grammar used for making interactive charts like these:

  ]}
/>

At Weights & Biases, I was tasked with building a Vega-based [custom chart editor](http://localhost:3000/vega). To develop user empathy, I decided to build my own custom chart. While learning the grammar, I realized that Vega's [Signals](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/signals/) feature makes it Turing complete. So naturally, I made my chart a side-scrolling platformer:

  ]}
/>

Every pixel of this world is a data point logged into Weights & Biases containing information about position and color information. This can be demonstrated by exploring and playing with the data using the W&B UI:

/>

I'm proud to say that the Vega team is officially featuring my "chart" as one of
its [example use cases](https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/platformer/).
