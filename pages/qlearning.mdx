When I first tried Q-learning, I was surprised how much time the agent needed to spend in the exploration phase before it was able to make meaningful progress. So I decided to make a very detailed [simulation](https://johnqian.com/qlearning) of a Q-learning agent in a very simple environment to help build intuition on how the agent learns. The environment I chose is called [NChain](https://gym.openai.com/envs/NChain-v0/).

I made the simulation at [Hack Lodge](https://hacklodge.org/) intending to use it in an educational Youtube video, but never got around to making the video. If I ever circle back to it, I'll write a more detailed explanation of what's going on in â€ he simulation here.
