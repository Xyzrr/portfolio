## Context

This was a hackathon project by me and my friend [Vish Rajiv](https://github.com/vwrj). It [won](https://twitter.com/AqeelMeetsWorld/status/1650279974405042178?s=20) us the Angellist Agents hackathon. The goal was simply to find an interesting form of an LLM agent--something that uses an LLM's output to determine its next input, and is thus able to run indefinitely.

## What is it?

Whybot builds a recursive knowledge graph around a seed question. You seed it with a question, it answers it, then asks follow up questions, answers those, and on. It's good for getting a really deep dive into a topic.

## Challenges

Making a parallel, streaming breadth-first-search that you can pause and resume was more tricky than I anticipated.
