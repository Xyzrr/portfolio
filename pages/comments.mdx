At Weights & Biases, I was tasked with designing a comment system for W&B Reports. Unlike most of my projects, I didn't write any of the code for this one, although I did code reviews. The implementation was done wonderfully by [Altay Guvench](https://github.com/altay).

## The Problem

Although many comment systems existed, none accomplished everything we wanted. Existing comment systems could roughly be broken into two categories:

- Disqus/Medium responses/Youtube-like, where thereâ€™s a comment section below the content that facilitates open discussion.
- Paper/Docs/Medium private notes/Gitbook-like, where comments appear alongside the content and reference specific parts, facilitating quick constructive feedback.

We received user requests asking for both types of comment systems, and both types made sense for us because reports were used for both scrappy notes and final presentations. So I proposed a hybrid approach designed to support both types of feedback in one system without sacrificing speed or intuitiveness.

## Process

Because I wasn't doing the implementation, I made a more comprehensive mock than usual.
