At Weights & Biases, I was tasked with designing a comment system for W&B Reports. I worked with engineer Altay Guvench on the implemention. Although many comment systems existed, none fulfilled our use case very well.

Existing comment systems could roughly be broken into two categories:

- Disqus/Medium responses/Youtube-like, where thereâ€™s a comment section below the content that facilitates open discussion.
- Paper/Docs/Medium private notes/Gitbook-like, where comments appear alongside the content and reference specific parts, facilitating quick constructive feedback.

We received user requests asking for both types of comment systems, and both types made sense for us because reports were used for both scrappy notes and final presentations. So I proposed a hybrid approach designed to support both types of feedback in one system without sacrificing speed or intuitiveness.
