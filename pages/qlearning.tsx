            When I first tried Q-learning, I was surprised how much time the
            agent needed to spend in the exploration phase before it was able to
            make meaningful progress. So I decided to make a very detailed{" "}
            <a href="https://johnqian.com/qlearning">simulation</a> of a
            Q-learning agent in a very simple environment to help build
            intuition on how the agent learns. The environment I chose is called{" "}
            <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/NChain-v0/">NChain</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I made the simulation at{" "}
            <a href="https://hacklodge.org/">Hack Lodge</a> intending to use it
            in an educational Youtube video, but never got around to making the
            video. If I ever circle back to it, I'll write a more detailed
            explanation of what's going on in â€ he simulation here.
